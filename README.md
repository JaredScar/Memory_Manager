Memory_Manager was a program designed to show how the memory is stored for jobs using the different memory fit algorithms. The program was made for Sister Jane's COM 310 Operating Systems assignment #2.
# Assumptions we made for this project:


# Memory Fit Algorithms Included:
## First Fit - Every process is added to the first hole it can fit in. If it can not fit in any hole, it will not be added.
## Best Fit - Every process is added into the smallest hole it can fit in. If it can not fit in any hole, it will not be added.
## Worst Fit - Every process is added into the largest hole it. If it can not fit in any hole, it will not be added.
